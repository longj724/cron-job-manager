# What is Cron Job Manager?

Cron Job Manager is a macOS desktop app that helps create and manage cron jobs on your system. CJM allows you to create cron jobs by selecting the script you would like to run as a job, and then specifying when you would like to run the job in plain English (e.g. run this job "Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon" ). There is no need to create scheduling expressions using the standard cron job syntax.

# Steps to Download

2. Navigate to the root directory and run `npm run make`
